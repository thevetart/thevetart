        <h1 class="text-center display-2 fw-bold">Welcome to VET<span class="light-green">a</span>RT</h1>
        <p>We are all well aware of the changes in our profession over the last years and we at VETaRT in no way wish to be judgemental 
            or to cast aspersions on the way that Veterinary Surgeons each individually carry out practice.  This approach has been called 
            contextual medicine but we wish to celebrate and encourage this concept and bring it into the main stream. Our aim is merely 
            to link likeminded clients with vets who are actively balancing the science and so called “Gold Standard” with the ART. All art 
            is a matter of opinion, and we all know that every case is different. Sometimes it is arguably not in the best interests of our 
            patient to do things that a purely scientific approach would actively encourage. At the other end of the scale some would even 
            suggest that omission may be considered wrong. A VETaRT Vet uses their clinical skills to negotiate and prioritise diagnostic 
            and treatment options. We believe that our clients deserve to be offered all the possible options but with a good dose of Art 
            from their Veterinary surgeon a tailored, ethical  and responsible way forward is available.</p>
        <p>We are asking Veterinary Surgeons who share our aim to sign up to our Mission Statement and they will be encouraged to display our logo.</p>
        <p><img src="img/logo.png" alt="VETaRT Logo" /></p>
        <p>This register of VETaRT Vets will be open access so clients can actively seek out a Vet who shares their ethos.</p>
        <p>A VETaRT vet will balance:
            <ul>
                <li>The patient factors, these are so very many but include the temperament, lifestyle, health and age of the patient</li>
                <li>The owners factors, these include their  financial situation, there compliance and expectations</li>
                <li>The risk/benefit and realistic prognosis of every procedure or treatment option</li>
                <li>The environmental impact of procedures especially for those that, whilst providing information, may have little or no
                     impact upon the outcome or current treatment</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>At all stages a VETaRT vet will consider and discuss all the many factors that affect our patients. This vital clinical acumen 
            contrasts the concept that our job involves taking the next step in an algorithm which should always be unquestionably followed.</p>
        <p>An informed client is a happy client and we hope a VETaRT Vet is a happier vet. Having agreed a treatment plan with the client 
            that prioritises patient welfare over slavishly following a prescribed plan that may have not been in the best interests of the patient.</p>
        <p>A VETaRT Vet undertakes to use their Veterinary Art in their day to day practice.</p>
