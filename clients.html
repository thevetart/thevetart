        <p>The concept of the ART of Veterinary Medicine is not new but in the rush to enjoy the huge recent advances in Veterinary 
            Science we at VETaRT wish to ensure that the  Art of Veterinary science is not a thing of the past. Our patients are the 
            focus of our care and their differences and varying needs are always in the forefront of our decision making. Our patients
             are also part of a family that may have, for example, financial or time constraints. All these factors are balance by 
             VETaRT Vets to reach a logical route through the process of diagnosis and treatment of our Patients.</p>
        <p>As a likeminded owner we encourage you to seek out a VETaRT vet on the available list.</p>
        <div>
            <select class="form-select mb-3" aria-label="VETaRT list" id="vetartList" onchange="changeVetArtList()">

        </div>
        <p>To understand we concept we must try to explain the thought process that vets are trained to use. In the fast majority of 
            cases the first step is to reach a diagnosis the cause of the presenting symptoms, for example , what is causing your pet not 
            to eat. In some cases this may be straightforward and established after a clinical exam. If further tests are required, e.g. 
            blood tests these are then performed, diagnosis, the process of establishing the case of the symptoms usually involves a series 
            of steps. Each step aims to achieve the aim of finding what disease is affecting our patients. It is a process of ruling in or 
            out the many causes possible and whilst it may be straightforward it often involves a step by step rule out of firstly common 
            and latterly less common causes of a problem.</p>
        <p>Each step involves a varying degree of involvement of the patient and their owner. For example a blood sample may be hugely stressful 
            to one patient or not even noticed by a second. It may involve an additional trip to the practice, with any associated issues such 
            as patient stress or even availability of transport. The costs of any test both financially and to the environment must be also 
            considered and balanced with the value of the information it may reveal.</p>
        <p>A VETaRT Vet considers the costs not just financial but environmental  and ethically on the patient and  each of these steps and they 
            must be balanced against the potential value and usefulness of the information likely to be obtained for each individual patient. For 
            example testing for a disease that requires treatment with tablets may not be of value to a patient that cannot take tablets. The 
            information obtained, even if it is just to rule out a disease will add to the clinical information but is it of value and will it 
            materially change the treatment plan for that individual patient?</p>
        <p>Once a definite or potentially presumed diagnosis is reached the next stage is forming a treatment plan, again, each patient as an 
            individual. This treatment plan should  always be tailored and the owner should be fully involved in producing this treatment plan. 
            For example the treatment a VETaRT Vet may suggest is appropriate for a young patient with no financial constraints may differ from 
            that which is appropriate for an elderly patient whose owners are financially restricted. A VETaRT vet will guide the owner, it is our 
            job to advise the owner not to dictate. Any treatment undertaken must be evaluated both by the vet and with appropriate guidance by the 
            owner for likely outcome and long-term effect on the patient. Whilst it is impossible to consider every possible pit fall in a treatment 
            plan a realistic evaluation of the suitability for each patient is part of the VETaRT ethos. We have a moral and ethical responsibility 
            to protect our patients from harm and above all never cause harm.</p>
        <p>At VETaRT we undertake to keep the patient and his or her welfare at the forefront at all stages. We have added some case studies to show 
            how the VETaRT thinking may work in some different. Click on the tabs below to investigate these.</p>

                    <p class="pt-1">Tibby is a 14 years old cat whose owner Mrs Smith is somewhat elderly. She struggles to get to the surgery as she 
                        doesn't drive and her husband sadly passed away 2 years ago. Despite needing to get a taxi Mrs Smith brings Tibby regularly to 
                        the surgery and 6 months ago Tibby was reported to be getting "a bit stiff" and was started on oral liquid pain killers. Since 
                        then Tibby has been very happy. Tibby came in for a routine annual vaccination. Whilst having her vaccination it was suggested 
                        that Tibby should have a routine blood test and despite her financial worries Mrs Smith agreed. This blood test suggested that 
                        Tibby may had early kidney damage. At this point there are several possible options.</p>
                    <p>The likely VETaRT option is to discuss all possible options but on questioning the problems with attending the surgery may limit 
                        the benefit of repeated visits. Tibby gets quite distressed and the cost of a taxi worries Mrs Smith. Tibby appears 100% healthy 
                        so a plan is made that involves obtaining a urine sample from Tibby when Mrs Smith's daughter is staying next month. This will be 
                        analysed to establish if any kidney medicines are indicated. Mrs Smith is not keen to change Tibby's diet as she is very fussy 
                        (there is some evidence that a prescription diet may slow the progression of kidney disease). Mrs Smith is warned that the painkiller 
                        that Tibby is having is officially contraindicated in kidney disease but as Tibby has benefitted so much it is decided that the 
                        dose will be reduced so Tibby is on the lowest effective dose.</p>
                    <p>Happy Tibby and Happy Mrs Smith</p>
                    <p>A second option would be that Tibby is immediately taken off her painkiller as the use is contraindicated for kidney disease. 
                        Tibby is now sore and grumpy. Mrs Smith gets a taxi to collect Tibby's new food and Tibby has a second trip to the surgery where 
                        she stays for a few hours to have her blood pressure taken. This suggests that Tibby's blood pressure is very slightly elevated, 
                        but Mrs Smith struggles to get Tibby to take the new tablets to treat the high blood pressure. Tibby is now not eating, in pain 
                        and refusing to take the new tablets. Mrs Smith is worrying about all the taxi and vets fees. Tibby won't sit on her knee anymore 
                        as she can't jump up any more and Tibby is losing weight as she doesn't like the new food.</p>
                    <p>Mrs Smith is worrying about Tibby as she doesn't seem a happy cat.</p>
                    <p>Of course this is the extremes and there are so many treatment plans that are available, for example try the new food but making it 
                        very clear that if Tibby doesn't like it then her old food is far preferable to not eating. Testing Tibby's blood pressure would be 
                        the ideal course of action but possibly only if the treatment can be administered easily. This is not in any way a criticism of vets 
                        but a VETaRT Vet can be expected to happily balance the need for clinical evaluation with the Individual Patient and their needs and 
                        restrictions.</p>

                    <p class="pt-1">Ben is a 12 year old Black Labrador who presents to his vet with problems getting up from rest. He is otherwise in good 
                        health but definitely less willing to go for walks these days. In clinical exam Ben has reduced muscle on both hind legs and resents 
                        hip extension of both hips. He is 2/10 lame when trotted up left hind. Ben is not insured and his owners, whilst wanting to do 
                        everything for Ben, do not feel they would opt for surgical intervention at this stage of his life, unless there was no other option.</p>
                    <p>Option 1: By far the most likely cause of Ben's lameness is arthritis so Ben is started on a regime of pain relief and tailored exercise 
                        and his owner is going to look into the option of some hydro therapy. The VetART vet and client discuss further tests such as X rays 
                        but as Ben's owner doesn't want surgery they are not performed at this stage. The pain relief will be reviewed regularly and x rays 
                        taken at any point if his degree of lameness suddenly changes</p>
                    <p>Ben is home, happy and rapidly improves on his new medication.</p>
                    <p>Option 2: There are other causes of his lameness  so Ben is admitted and after blood tests he is sedated and X rays taken of his hips 
                        and stifles. These show he has a significant degree of hip dysplasia in both hips. The vet is keen for Ben to have bilateral hip 
                        replacements and he is referred for the surgery. Despite both surgeries going to plan Ben spends a large part of the next 6 months 
                        either having surgery or recovering from his surgery. He has repeated trips to the vets with follow up X rays of both hips.</p>
                    <p>Ben is very comfortable at 6 months but has now got some elbow pain so he is on pain relief.</p>
